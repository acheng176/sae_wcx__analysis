OEMs must now balance differentiating in-vehicle features for consumer acceptance while maintaining a non-negotiable “safety first” brand. So, what does this SDV approach provide for the OEM and consumer? What are the benefits to new value chain and expanded lifecycle of the vehicle provide and what are the challenges? Finally, while the vehicle integration with smart devices is a requirement for the customer, is there a stronger need for interdependencies between ADAS and HMI from a systems approach that provide services consumers want while making sure it is not a distraction.",

These dynamic developments necessitate iterative, integrated design development including with supply\nchain partners and across other business functions, such as contracts, marketing and subscription service teams, and aftermarket services.\nThis session explores Systems approaches for business level decision-making and the trends for Systems Engineering adoption against this backdrop of\nhistoric change. We consider industry’s ability to keep pace and systemically adopt Systems Engineering – for design practices and workforce\ndevelopment; among supply chain interactions and organizational restructuring; and to inform and influence business decisions and strategic external\nparties.",
