While the momentum behind electrification grows, internal combustion engines (ICEs) continue to drive the majority of vehicles worldwide. Rather than viewing ICEs and EVs as opposing solutions, the path forward must integrate advancements in fuel technology, engine efficiency, and emission reduction to ensure holistic solutions are easily accessible and advantageous in response to differing challenges. This panel will delve into how advancements in fuel technology, hybrid systems, and forward-thinking policies can transform the transportation landscape while maximizing the potential of existing infrastructure. Our goal is to examine how ICE vehicles can be optimized in our path towards a lower-carbon future, ensuring a smooth transition toward sustainability.",

    "overview": "In 2024, most major OEMs have achieved proficiency in L2 driver assistance systems. However, progressing from L2 to L3 marks a substantial transformation. Whereas L2 denotes advanced driver support features, L3 initiates conditional autonomous driving, permitting the driver to avert their attention from the road once specific conditions are met. Consequently, when OEMs introduce L3 vehicles, they must anticipate unique issues that L3 systems provide when they are enabled. They must also look at the Human Factors and other persistent challenges (HMI, Enhanced Sensor Technology, Cyber Security, ML/AI, Redundancy, HD-Maps, and Certification – state by state) that require strategies/solutions in order for OEMs to build confidence to deploy their L3 systems.",

They address the current state of consumer acceptance, regulations, and market viability. Customer acceptance is the key factor in the success of any propulsion or powertrain system. Consumers must be willing to accept the system and its associated costs and benefits. Regulations also play a significant role in the design and development of propulsion and powertrain systems. Regulations must be met in order for the system to be legally compliant. Through analyst examinations, you can gain better insights on design and systems that meets the needs of your customers, complies with regulations, and is viable in the marketplace.",
